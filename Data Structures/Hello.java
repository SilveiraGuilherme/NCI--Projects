/* An array can store information in cells, for example:

["Keith", "Bob", "Jane"], content is accessed by the indexes 0, 1, 2

Continuous memory allocation - No need for extra info to find elements (array)

Linked memory allocation - Need to add 'nodes' that point to the next object.
We need to be able to have an object (basic building block that we are going to create) that will hold the information
that we are going to store and a reference pointer to the next element in our data structure.
